power of two
8/2=4;  4/2=2; 2/2=1;

improve power of two
if x*x-1 will be 0;
let x=4 --100
  x-1=3 --011
  x&x-1=  000
let x=5 --101
  x-1=4 --100
  x&x-1=  101

*find of number of one in binary representation
4=100=>number one is 1
5=101=>number one is 2
iteration time log(2)

bit manipulation worst case log(2)

equation is x&x-1
